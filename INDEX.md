## Secondary Skills — When to Pair

Secondary skills are invoked *alongside* a primary skill, not instead of one.

| If you're doing... | Also invoke |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Implementing features that touch the API | `@api-design` |
| Implementing features that change models/schema | `@data-modeling` |
| Implementing backend features on hot paths or with caching | `@performance` |
| Implementing frontend features with performance concerns | `@frontend-perf` |
| Completing implementation before handoff | `@self-review` |
| Reviewing API surface changes | `@api-design` |
| Reviewing schema changes or migrations | `@data-modeling` |
| Reviewing backend performance-critical code | `@performance` |
| Reviewing frontend performance-critical code | `@frontend-perf` |
| Investigating a bug | `@debugging` |
| Cleaning up code as part of a task | `@refactoring` |
| Planning work breakdown | `@task-decomposition` |
| High-stakes decisions with unclear tradeoffs | `@decision-framework` |
| Assessing task difficulty | `@confidence-scoring` |
| Managing large codebase navigation | `@context-strategy` |
| Handling failures or errors | `@error-recovery` |

## Handoff Chain

```
@pm          →  Scoped requirements with acceptance criteria
  @ux        →  User flows and component specs
    @arch    →  System design and implementation plan
      @dev   →  Working implementation
        @self-review → Pre-handoff quality check
          @guard →  Code review: security, correctness, conventions
            @qa  →  Testing: edge cases, coverage, regressions
```

**Skip any step that doesn't apply.** A bug fix doesn't need `@pm` or `@ux`. A content task doesn't need `@arch`.

---

## Autonomous Workflow

For fully autonomous AI development:

```
1. @task-decomposition  →  Break feature into small, testable tasks
2. @confidence-scoring  →  Assess confidence for each task; ask before low-confidence ones
3. @context-strategy    →  Load only what's needed for the current task
4. @arch                →  Design system structure if needed
5. @dev                 →  Implement
6. @self-review         →  Check own work before handoff
7. @guard               →  Security/convention review
8. @qa                  →  Test
```

**`@error-recovery` is not a sequential step** — invoke it at any point when a test, build, or deployment fails.

**`@confidence-scoring` applies per task**, not just once at the start. Re-assess before each task in the decomposed list.

## Usage Examples

### Loading Skills in Different AI Assistants

**Claude/Cursor:**
```
Load skills: @pm, @ux, @arch, @dev, @guard, @qa

Task: Add user authentication to the dashboard
```

**GitHub Copilot Chat:**
```
#file:skills/product/pm.md
#file:skills/coding/arch.md
#file:skills/coding/dev.md
#file:skills/coding/guard.md

Help me scope and implement user authentication
```

**Windsurf:**
```
@pm @arch @dev @guard

I need to add user authentication. Help me scope it first, then design and implement securely.
```
