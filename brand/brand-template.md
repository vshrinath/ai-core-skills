## Using This File

This file is loaded by all marketing personas (`@video`, `@video-ai`, `@writer`, `@seo`, `@perf`).

**To customize for your project:** Replace the bracketed placeholders with your brand's identity, voice, audience, colors, and positioning. The persona files remain unchanged — they reference `brand/brand-template.md` generically.
